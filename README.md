# MyBooks app - A Book Tracking app

This app provides the user with list of books displaying the shelves they are present in. Also it provides user to place the book in one of the three shelves namely:

* Currently Reading.
* Want To Read.
* Read.

The interface is divided into 3 parts displaying 3 shelves and the books placed in those shelves. User can also search for a book(search results are limited to a particular set of search terms refer [SEARCH_TERMS.md] (SEARCH_TERMS.md)) and from those results can place the book into one of the 3 shelves.

Technologies:

* React JS
* HTML
* CSS


## Use the App right away:

* Clone the repository in your local system.
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
